            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="text">This is some information about me! Im from Nashville, TN but I now live in Silverton, OR. I went to university at Middle Tennessee State and complete a degree in Aerospace technology in 2022 as well as a degree in Computer Science in 2024. I started to learn web development during my final year of university, and, after a short break from programming post graduation, I've continued to spend my free time learning more about web dev. Aside from that, I also have many other interests, such as cooking, hiking, listening to music, playing guitar, and spending time with friends. Recently I've decided it was time once again to search for a job more inline with my goals. The only problem is I don't know exactly what that means yet! I know I love to program and use computers to make useful and interesting software, however, because my interests are so varied, I don't know which path I want to pursue over the long term. As of right now, I enjoy web development the best and am very interested in working as a professional web developer. But I would also love the opportunity to apply the knowledge I gained from my Aerospace technology degree. My dream positions at the present are to work on a large scale website as a developer, or to work on programming flight avionics.</div>
